The challenge is on a website that  poses really cool questions to write single line bash commands for several tasks including:
Print “Hello World”
Print the current working directory
List names of all the files in the current directory,one file per line.
There is a file named “access.log” in the current directory. Print the contents.
Print the last 5 lines of “access.log”
Create an empty file named take-the-command-challenge in the current working directory.
Create a directory named tmp/files in the current working directory

and many others that increase in complexity as you go.
